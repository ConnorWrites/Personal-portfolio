This is my Personal Portfolio Website showcasing frontend projects, skills, and contact information.

It consists of three files:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

Contains separate sections:
- About Me
- Projects
- Skills
- Contact

And was built to:
- Practice responsive web design
- Showcase my frontend projects
- Provide a central place for employers to view my work.

Future improvements would include:
- Adding more projects
- Improving animations and transitions
- Converting to a framework-based version (React).
